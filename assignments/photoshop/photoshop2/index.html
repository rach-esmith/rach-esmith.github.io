        <p class="veggies">In order to compose this image, I used a variety of techniques to select the different vegetables and create individual layers for each of them so they could then be arranged on top of the cutting board. These included the use of the Magic Wand, Quick Selection, Elliptical Marquee, and Polygonal/Magnetic Lasso tools. I also created the drop-shadow effect by using the Layer Styles menu.</p></div>

        <p class="postcard">I put this postcard together by taking separate images and combining them into one document with multiple layers, and editing each one individually.</p>
        <p class="postcard">The drop-shadow, gradient, and outline effects were done in the Layer Styles menu on the text, photograph, and flower layers. I also edited the flower using the Satin layer style. To make the pineapple more vibrant, I duplicated the layer and set the copy to Overlay in the Blending Mode menu. To make the postage stamp see-though, I lowered the opacity.</p>
        <p class="postcard">For the background, I made a new layer and set my foreground color swatch to a light blue color. I then chose 'Filter' —> 'Render' —> 'Clouds' to create the cloudy sky effect.</p>
