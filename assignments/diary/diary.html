        <h1>Hello Humans</h1>
        
        My name is Pickle, and I will be keeping this diary to document the daily 
        struggles I face while my owner is away at college.
        
        <h2>December 10th, 2014</h2>

            It has been weeks since the last time Rachael came home. Where is she?
            Will I ever see her again? These thoughts trouble me greatly. I will                   continue to keep watch for her, but kindling the fires of hope becomes more
            and more difficult with each passing day. The other humans will not let me 
            sleep with them after I sat on their heads the other night.
            <p>I fear it will be a long winter.</p><br style="clear:both;" />
    
        <h2>December 17th, 2014</h2>

            Rachael is home! She allowed me to nap on her all afternoon, and stayed 
            still the entire time so as not to rouse me from my dreams, a
            consideration none of the other humans care to take. Then, when I awoke
            in the throes of hunger, she followed me into the kitchen and fed me!                   Christmas has certainly come early this year.<br style="clear:both;" />
        
        <h2>December 26th, 2014</h2>
            I have composed a haiku to summarize what I learned today.
            <blockquote><center>Are video games
            <br>more important than snuggles?
            <br>If they are new: yes.
            </center></blockquote>
        
        <h2>January 18th, 2015</h2>
            <img src="suitcase.png" class="left">
            The time has come for Rachael to leave once again. It was a wonderful month
             while it lasted.
            <p>I have infiltrated her suitcase in the hopes that she will take me with
             her, but alas I fear she is too intelligent for such a ploy. I will have
             to begin preparing myself for another month of isolation in the event that
             I am not successful.</p><br style="clear:both;" />
