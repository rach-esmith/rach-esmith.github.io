<h1>Streaming from Google Chrome to Your TV</h1>

<p>Now that you have prepared the Chromecast and set up your browser, you are fully equipped to start streaming, or in this case, “Casting” from your laptop. Unlike with a phone or a tablet, which only allow you to Cast from specific apps, while using your laptop you are able to stream anything you can view within your Google Chrome browser.</p>

<ol><li>Connect your laptop to the same Wi-Fi network as your Chromecast.</li>
<li>Open Google Chrome and click on the Chromecast icon in the top right corner of your browser.</li>
<li>Click on the name of your Chromecast under “Cast this tab to…” 
<p><img src="images/castthisto.png"></p>The page you currently have as your active tab appears on your TV.
<p id="note">Note that you are not able to see your laptop’s cursor on the TV screen, but can click and interact with buttons and links the same way you normally would.</p></li>
