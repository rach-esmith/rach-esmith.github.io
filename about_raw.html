        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Rachael Smith. I'm a copywriter with 3 years of in-house marketing experience. I love writing creatively and applying that to everything I do.</p>
        
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I spend most of my free time writing short stories and coming up with ideas for various creative projects that may or may not ever see the light of day. When it comes to reading, nothing beats fantasy and sci-fi.</p>
        
        <p>If I'm not writing, I'm usually playing video games. I'm currently overinvested in <i>Overwatch</i> and slowly catching up on my vast backlog of unfinished games.</p>
        
        <p>I occasionally dabble in web development, mostly through this website and Tumblr blog themes.</p>

        <p>I'm also very fond of cats, <i>Star Wars</i>, and superhero movies.</p>

        <h3>Résumé</h3>
        <p>For a brief summary of my work experience, education, and qualifications, please take a look at my résumé.</p>
