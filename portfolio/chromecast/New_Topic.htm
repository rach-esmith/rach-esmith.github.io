	<h1>Preparing a Chromecast for Use</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>First, you’ll need to plug your Chromecast device into an HDMI 
		 port on your TV. These are typically located on the back of the 
		 TV screen.</li>
		<li>Begin charging your Chromecast by locating the cord that came 
		 with the device. Insert the appropriate ends into the Chromecast 
		 device and your TV’s USB port. This should be located somewhere 
		 near the HDMI port. A red light is now lit on your Chromecast, 
		 indicating that it is currently charging.</li>
		<li>Use your TV’s remote to change the source to the HDMI input 
		 you plugged the Chromecast into. You can now see your device’s 
		 setup name in the bottom left corner of the screen. </li>
		<li>Visit <a href="https://cast.google.com/chromecast/setup/" id="link">cast.google.com/chromecast/setup/</a> 
		 in order to download the Chromecast app and set up your preferences 
		 for the device. Click the Download button, and install the app 
		 as prompted. This can be done on either a laptop or phone/tablet.</li>
		<li>Open the app once it is installed and click Accept on the Privacy 
		 Terms page that pops up.</li>
		<li>Wait while Chromecast attempts to locate your device. Your 
		 computer should be no more than 20 feet away in order for it to 
		 be correctly detected. </li>
		<li>Click the Set Up button once Chromecast has located your device. 
		 A code appears on your laptop, phone, or tablet’s screen. It should 
		 also appear on your TV. Click ‘I see the code’ when it does.</li>
		<li>Name your Chromecast device if you would like to, then click 
		 ‘Set.’</li>
		<li>Input your Wi-Fi information into the provided form. If your 
		 Wi-Fi is password protected, input the password as well.</li>
		<li>Click ‘Finish Setup.’ Congratulations, your Chromecast is now 
		 fully prepared for use!</li>
