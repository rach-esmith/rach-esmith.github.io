	<h1>Casting from a Phone or Tablet</h1>
	<p>Utilizing a Chromecast from your phone or tablet requires very little 
	 setup and is the most convenient way to enjoy the Chromecast’s features. 
	 There are lots of available apps that are compatible with the Chromecast. 
	 For a full list visit: <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/apps.html" 
								 id="link">google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/apps.html</a></p>
	<p>This guide demonstrates how to stream videos from YouTube. Once 
	 you know how to use Chromecast with this app, you should be ready 
	 to “Cast” from any Chromecast-ready app you like!</p>
	<h2>Casting from YouTube:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Connect your phone or tablet to the same Wi-Fi network as your 
		 Chromecast.</li>
		<li>Open up the YouTube App. As long as you are on the correct 
		 Wi-Fi network, you should see the Chromecast logo in the top right 
		 of the app.</li>
		<li>Tap on the logo and select the name of the Chromecast device 
		 you want to connect to. The YouTube logo appears on your TV screen, 
		 and you can <br />
		now search for a video to stream to your TV.</li>
		<li>Find the video you want to Cast, and then tap the play button. 
		 A pop up appears asking if you want to play it or add the video 
		 to a queue. Building up a queue is a great way to keep the videos 
		 going, and anyone on the same Wi-Fi as the Chromecast can contribute 
		 to it!</li>
		<li>Disconnect from the Chromecast at any time by tapping on the 
		 Comecast logo and choosing 'Disconnect.'</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For help using your Chromecast on other compatible apps, check out 
	 the Google Chrome YouTube channel, which features a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5aqr5w5fRe6mmwBXBPJA6s4c0Fd7EYBq"

	 of Chromecast guided tours to walk you through more apps and features 
	 you might not know about.</p>
